Known Issues: During the tutorial work, I had issues getting the code for the Health Bar, throwing cog, and the Raycasting dialogue, as I kept getting "this does not exist" errors.

Team members for the final Project: Daniel Krupczak, Ryan Horton.
I am having extreme trouble getting in contact with my team members, I tried contacting them to gather together and work together on the project, with currently no response.
